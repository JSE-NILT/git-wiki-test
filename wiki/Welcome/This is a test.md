# This is a test

Test wiki page, just to try out the functionallity. There is **no** deeper meaning to any of this.
It's just to try out how this works and looks. Like a link to the [demo](http://www.drassil.org/git-wiki/main_page) page, for this theme.

## Animals

I could also do a table over good and *evil* animals

| Good | Evil |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Big dogs | Cats |
| Chickens | Small dogs | 


## A usefull function

Here is a really usefull function:
"""python
def add(a, b):
  return a + b
"""

It does one thing, and one thing only:
- Adds the two numbers, `a` and `b`
- Thats it
  - Really!

### Picture
Here is a pricture of a good animal:
